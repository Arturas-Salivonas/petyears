    question: "Why do cats age differently than dogs?",
    answer: "Cats have a different aging pattern than dogs. While dogs reach maturity quickly, cats mature more gradually. A 1-year-old cat is roughly equivalent to a 15-year-old human, similar to dogs, but their aging progression differs throughout their lifespan."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the cat age calculator?",
    answer: "Our calculator uses scientific formulas based on veterinary research about feline aging patterns. It provides accurate estimates for most domestic cats, though individual factors like breed, health, and lifestyle can influence actual aging."
  },
  {
    question: "Do different cat breeds age differently?",
    answer: "Yes, breed size and type can affect lifespan and aging patterns. Larger cat breeds may age slightly differently than smaller ones, and some purebred cats have different life expectancies than mixed-breed cats."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I recalculate my cat's age?",
    answer: "You can recalculate anytime! As your cat enters their senior years (typically 7+ years), their human age equivalent will change. Regular check-ups with your veterinarian are recommended to monitor your cat's health."

  {
    question: "What's the average lifespan of a domestic cat?",
    answer: "Domestic cats typically live 12-15 years, though this can vary significantly based on breed, diet, exercise, veterinary care, and living environment. Indoor cats generally live longer than outdoor cats."
