    question: "Why do dogs age faster than humans?",
    answer: "Dogs reach maturity much faster than humans. A 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 15-year-old human in terms of physical and mental development. This accelerated aging continues throughout their shorter lifespan."

  {
    question: "Is the calculator accurate for mixed breeds?",
    answer: "Our calculator provides a general estimate based on average dog aging patterns. Mixed breeds may age differently depending on their dominant genetic traits. For the most accurate assessment, consult with your veterinarian."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I recalculate my dog's age?",
    answer: "You can recalculate anytime! As your dog ages, their human equivalent age will change. It's especially useful to track this as they enter their senior years (typically 7+ dog years) to adjust their care routine."

  {
    question: "What's the difference between small, medium, large, and giant breed dogs?",
    answer: "Breed size significantly impacts lifespan and aging patterns. Small breeds (â‰¤10kg) typically live 12-15 years, medium breeds (10-25kg) live 10-13 years, large breeds (25-45kg) live 8-12 years, and giant breeds (45kg+) live 6-10 years."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the 1 dog year = 7 human years rule?",
    answer: "The traditional 1:7 rule is a rough estimate that's not very accurate. Modern veterinary science shows that dogs age much faster in their first two years (1 year = 15 human years, 2 years = 24 human years), then slow down significantly."
