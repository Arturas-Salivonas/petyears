# Cat Years Calculator: Myths and Facts

Cats age differently than dogs, and there are several myths about how to calculate their "human age" equivalent.

## Common Myths

### Myth 1: Cats age at a 7:1 ratio
This is a common misconception. While dogs do age roughly 7 times faster than humans, cats have a more complex aging pattern.

### Myth 2: All cats age the same way
Just like humans, cats age at different rates based on breed, size, and health.

## The Accurate Formula

For cats, the aging formula is more nuanced:

- **First year**: 15 human years
- **Second year**: 9 human years (total 24)
- **Third year**: 4 human years (total 28)
- **Each subsequent year**: 4 human years

This means a 5-year-old cat is approximately 36 in human years, not 35 as the simplified formula would suggest.

## Factors Affecting Cat Aging

- **Breed**: Some breeds like Persians age differently
- **Indoor vs Outdoor**: Indoor cats often live longer
- **Diet and Health**: Well-cared-for cats age more gracefully
- **Spaying/Neutering**: Can affect lifespan

Always consult your veterinarian for the most accurate assessment of your cat's health and aging.
